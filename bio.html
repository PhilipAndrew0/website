                <p class="first-indent">
                    <sup><b>1</b></sup>My name is Philip Andrew Paradiang.
                    <sup><b>2</b></sup> I grew up in Tondo, Manila, and this is where I was born too.
                    <sup><b>3</b></sup> My parents were always supportive, encouraging me to be curious and explore the world around me.
                    <sup><b>4</b></sup> I always wanted to play outside, and sometimes I wanted to skip school just to play, but my parents wouldn't let me.
                    <sup><b>5</b></sup> When it was my first time going to school, I cried because I didn't want my mom to leave me there.
                    <sup><b>6</b></sup> My mom would read bedtime stories to me and my siblings.
                    <sup><b>7</b></sup> Even though I was still young, I liked to spend time drawing, making little sketches of the things I saw in anime.
                    <sup><b>8</b></sup> I wasn't great at art, but it felt fun and relaxing.
                    <sup><b>9</b></sup> School was a place where I could make friends and show what I had learned.
                    <sup><b>10</b></sup> I'm not a smart kid, but my teachers were very kind and helped me grow.
                    <sup><b>11</b></sup> I love visiting my grandparents because they're so kind to me, and I love them.
                    <sup><b>12</b></sup> I also spent a lot of time with my friends from the neighborhood.
                    <sup><b>13</b></sup> We would ride our bikes around the block or play hide and seek outside.
                    <sup><b>14</b></sup> Our days were filled with simple games like luksong baka, hide and seek, and tumbang preso.
                    <sup><b>15</b></sup> On rainy days, I was happy when the class got suspended and I got to watch cartoons all day.
                    <sup><b>16</b></sup> The town I grew up in was lively, and I still cherish the friendships I made here.
                    <sup><b>17</b></sup> My childhood was a time of exploration, learning, and laying the foundation for my future.
                    <sup><b>18</b></sup> My parents always found a way to give us opportunities to learn and grow.
                    <sup><b>19</b></sup> Those moments made me feel happy and safe, and they helped me grow into who I am today.
                    <sup><b>20</b></sup> Looking back, I realize how much those small moments shaped my love for nature, learning, and being creative.

                <p class="first-indent">
                    <sup><b>1</b></sup>When I reached my teenage years, this was the time I got to understand things I didn't understand when I was still a kid.
                    <sup><b>2</b></sup> What I knew back then was just to play, but when I reached high school, I learned that there was more to life besides playing.
                    <sup><b>3</b></sup> I discovered new hobbies like playing online games and basketball.
                    <sup><b>4</b></sup> I'm not that good at those things, but if they make you happy, you don't have to listen to what other people say.
                    <sup><b>5</b></sup> When I became a teenager, everything started to change.
                    <sup><b>6</b></sup> High school was both exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time.
                    <sup><b>7</b></sup> I had to adjust to new classes, teachers, and a larger group of students.
                    <sup><b>8</b></sup> At first, I felt a little lost and unsure of myself, but I soon made new friends who shared similar interests, I gained self-confidence.
                    <sup><b>9</b></sup> I was a problem child when I was in high school, so my parents got called often by my teachers because I was so naughty.
                    <sup><b>10</b></sup> But even if I was like this, I still prioritized my grades to not let my parents down.
                    <sup><b>11</b></sup> My grades were not that high, but I always did my best to not let my parents be disappointed in me.
                    <sup><b>12</b></sup> My friends and I spent a lot of time hanging out after school, watching movies, or just talking about life.
                    <sup><b>13</b></sup> I realized that these friendships were very important to me, and I wanted to make them last.
                    <sup><b>14</b></sup> As I got older, I also started to think about my future more seriously.
                    <sup><b>15</b></sup> I knew I wanted to go to college, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to study yet.
                    <sup><b>16</b></sup> However, I knew that I wanted to do something that would help me reach my dreams.
                    <sup><b>17</b></sup> I spent time researching different careers and talking to adults who worked in fields I was interested in.
                    <sup><b>18</b></sup> I wanted to be a seaman just like my father, but I changed my mind and chose this program.
                    <sup><b>19</b></sup> My parents continued to encourage me, and they always reminded me to follow my passions.
                    <sup><b>20</b></sup> My teenage years were full of ups and downs, but they helped me grow stronger and more sure of myself.
                    <sup><b>21</b></sup> By the time I graduated, I felt ready to take on whatever came next in life, knowing that the lessons from high school would stay with me.

                <p class="first-indent">
                    <sup><b>1</b></sup>College was a whole new world for me, full of challenges and opportunities.
                    <sup><b>2</b></sup> At first, I felt nervous stepping into this new phase of my life.
                    <sup><b>3</b></sup> I chose to study Computer Science because I have always been fascinated by technology and how things work behind the scenes.
                    <sup><b>4</b></sup> The first few weeks were tough—I had to adjust to a new environment, new people, and a different way of learning.
                    <sup><b>5</b></sup> Unlike high school, college required me to be more independent and responsible for my own studies.
                    <sup><b>6</b></sup> There were times when I doubted myself, wondering if I had chosen the right path.
                    <sup><b>7</b></sup> But as I continued to learn, I started to enjoy the challenges.
                    <sup><b>8</b></sup> Coding, problem-solving, and working on projects helped me develop skills that I never thought I could master.
                    <sup><b>9</b></sup> There were nights when I barely got any sleep because of deadlines and exams.
                    <sup><b>10</b></sup> But I knew that all of this hard work would pay off in the future.
                    <sup><b>11</b></sup> I also met amazing classmates and friends who helped me through the tough times.
                    <sup><b>12</b></sup> We formed study groups, shared notes, and motivated each other to keep going.
                    <sup><b>13</b></sup> I even discovered new interests, such as web development and software engineering.
                    <sup><b>14</b></sup> College wasn't just about academics—it was also about personal growth.
                    <sup><b>15</b></sup> I learned how to manage my time, set goals, and push myself beyond my limits.
                    <sup><b>16</b></sup> I also took on part-time work to help ease the financial burden of my education.
                    <sup><b>17</b></sup> It wasn't easy balancing work and studies, but it taught me the value of perseverance and discipline.
                    <sup><b>18</b></sup> As I near the end of my college journey, I feel proud of how far I've come.
                    <sup><b>19</b></sup> The challenges I faced only made me stronger and more determined to succeed.
                    <sup><b>20</b></sup> I know that graduation is just the beginning, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me next.
                    <sup><b>21</b></sup> No matter what happens, I will always remember the lessons I learned in college and use them as a foundation for my future.
